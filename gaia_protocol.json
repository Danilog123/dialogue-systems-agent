With her roots in Argentine folk music, Sosa became one of the preeminent exponents of El nuevo cancionero. She gave voice to songs written by many Latin American songwriters. Her music made people hail her as the \"voice of the voiceless ones\".[2] She was often called \"the conscience of Latin America\".[3]\n\nSosa performed in venues such as the Lincoln Center in New York City, the Th√©√¢tre Mogador in Paris, the Sistine Chapel in Vatican City, as well as sold-out shows in New York's Carnegie Hall and the Roman Colosseum during her final decade of life. Her career spanned four decades and she was the recipient of six Latin Grammy awards (2000, 2003, 2004, 2006, 2009, 2011), including a Latin Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award in 2004 and two posthumous Latin Grammy Award for Best Folk Album in 2009 and 2011. She won the Premio Gardel in 2000, the main musical award in Argentina. She served as an ambassador for UNICEF.\n\nLife[edit]\n\nSosa was born on 9 July 1935, in San Miguel de Tucum√°n, in the northwestern Argentine province of Tucum√°n, of mestizo ancestry. She was of French, Spanish and Diaguita descent.[4] Her nickname \"la negra\", which is a common nickname in Argentina for people with darker complexion, is a reference to her indigenous heritage.[5] Her parents, a day laborer and a washerwoman,[3] were Peronists, although they never registered in the party, and she started her career as a singer for the Peronist Party in Tucuman under the name Gladys Osorio.[6] In 1950, at age fifteen, she won a singing competition organized by a local radio station and was given a contract to perform for two months.[7] She recorded her first album, La Voz de la Zafra, in 1959.[7] A performance at the 1965 Cosqu√≠n National Folklore Festival‚Äîwhere she was introduced and brought to the stage while sitting in the audience by fellow folk singer Jorge Cafrune‚Äî[8] brought her to the attention of the Argentine public.[7] Sosa and her first husband, Manuel Oscar Matus, with whom she had one son, were key players in the mid-60s nueva canci√≥n movement (which was called nuevo cancionero in Argentina).[9] Her second record was Canciones con Fundamento, a collection of Argentine folk songs.\n\nSosa with F√©lix Luna and Ariel Ram√≠rez (at the piano)\n\nSosa \"spent the late 1960s building her audience in Europe and among the cosmopolitan middle class in Buenos Aires, becoming in the process a much bigger star\" than her contemporaries.[10] In 1967, Sosa toured the United States and Europe with great success.[citation needed] In later years, she performed and recorded extensively, broadening her repertoire to include material from throughout Latin America.\n\nIn the early 1970s, Sosa released two concept albums in collaboration with composer Ariel Ram√≠rez and lyricist F√©lix Luna: Cantata Sudamericana and Mujeres Argentinas (Argentine Women). She also recorded a tribute to Chilean musician Violeta Parra in 1971, including what was to become one of Sosa's signature songs, Gracias a la vida.[4][11] She further popularized of songs written by Milton Nascimento of Brazil and Pablo Milan√©s and Silvio Rodr√≠guez both from Cuba.[4] Throughout the decade, she released albums such as Hasta la Victoria in 1972 and Traigo un Pueblo en mi Voz in 1973. They featured songs like \"Cuando tenga la tierra\", written by Ariel Petrocelli and Daniel Toro, which tackles political and social issues like wealth and land inequality.[12][13] During the 1970s she was a part of two films by the director Leopoldo Torre Nilsson: El Santo de la Espada in 1970 and G√ºemes, la tierra en armas in 1971, in which she portrayed Juana Azurduy de Padilla, the guerrilla military leader who fought for Argentine independence.[12][14]\n\nSosa in 1972\n\nAfter the military junta of Jorge Videla came to power in 1976, the atmosphere in Argentina grew increasingly oppressive. Sosa faced death threats against both her and her family, but refused for many years to leave the country. At a concert in La Plata in 1979, Sosa was searched and arrested on stage, along with all those attending the concert.[9] Their release came about through international intervention.[7] Despite attempts to hold more concerts, she was officially barred from performing by the military regime.[5] Banned in her own country, she moved to Paris and then to Madrid.[7][9] She has spoken publicly about her artistic and emotional struggles during this period of her life.[5] While in exile, she released the album A Quien Doy in 1981. The album included a recording of the song \"Cuando Me Acuerdo de Mi Pais\" which was originally written by the prolific Chilean singer/songwriter, Patricio Manns. The song, which he wrote while also in political exile, expresses the sorrow he felt from being separated from his homeland.[15] She related to this feeling and struggled to continue recording and performing. In an interview with the New York Times, she said, ‚ÄúIt was a mental problem, a problem of morale...It wasn‚Äôt my throat, or anything physical\".[5]\n\nSosa returned to Argentina from her exile in Europe in February 1982,[16][9] several months before the military regime collapsed as a result of the Falklands War, and gave a series of concerts at the Teatro √ìpera in Buenos Aires, where she invited many of her younger colleagues to share the stage. A double album of recordings, Mercedes Sosa en Argentina, from these performances became an instant best seller. She then traveled to perform in her home province of Tucuman. However, these performances were largely ignored by mainstream media in the country.[16] In subsequent years, Sosa continued to tour both in Argentina and abroad, performing in such venues as the Lincoln Center in New York City and the Th√©√¢tre Mogador in Paris. In poor health for much of the 1990s, she performed a comeback show in Argentina in 1998.[7] In 1994, she played in the Sistine Chapel in Vatican City.[4] In 2002, she sold out both Carnegie Hall in New York and the Colosseum in Rome in the same year.[4]\n\nSosa in 1973\n\nA supporter of Per√≥n, she favored leftist causes throughout her life. She supported President Raul Alfonsin in the election of 1983 which marked the return of democracy in Argentina following the dictatorship. She referred to this election as \"Argentina's Spring\"[17] She opposed President Carlos Menem, who was in office from 1989 to 1999, and supported the election of N√©stor Kirchner, who became president in 2003.[18] Sosa was a UNESCO Goodwill Ambassador for Latin America and the Caribbean.[9][19]\n\nSosa disliked being identified as a protest singer.[3][20] While she was outright in her political stances, Sosa said the following on the position of the artist:\n\n‚ÄúAn artist isn‚Äôt political in the party political sense ‚Äì they have a constituency, which is their public ‚Äì it is the poetry that matters most of all.‚Äù\n\nIn a career spanning four decades, she worked with performers across several genres and generations, folk, opera, pop, rock, including Martha Argerich, Andrea Bocelli, David Broza, Franco Battiato, Jaime Roos, Joan Baez, Francis Cabrel, Gal Costa, Luz Casal, Lila Downs, Lucio Dalla, Maria Farantouri, Lucecita Benitez, Nilda Fern√°ndez, Charly Garcia, Le√≥n Gieco, Gian Marco, Nana Mouskouri, Pablo Milan√©s, Holly Near, Milton Nascimento, Pata Negra, Fito P√°ez, Franco De Vita, Lourdes P√©rez, Luciano Pavarotti, Silvio Rodr√≠guez, Ismael Serrano, Shakira, Sting, Caetano Veloso,[4] Julieta Venegas, Gustavo Cerati and Konstantin Wecker[9]\n\nSosa participated in a 1999 production of Ariel Ram√≠rez's Misa Criolla.[21] Her song Balderrama is featured in the 2008 movie Che, starring Benicio del Toro as the Argentine Marxist revolutionary Che Guevara.[22]\n\nSosa was the co-chair of the Earth Charter International Commission.\n\nAwards[edit]\n\nSosa won the Latin Grammy Award for Best Folk Album in 2000 (Misa Criolla),[23] 2003 (Ac√∫stico),[24] 2006 (Coraz√≥n Libre),[25] 2009 (Cantora 1, which also won Best Recording Package and was nominated for Album of the Year),[26] and 2011 (Deja La Vida Volar),[27] as well as several international awards.\n\nIn 1995, Konex Foundation from Argentina granted her the Diamond Konex Award, one of the most prestigious awards in Argentina, as the most important personality in the popular music of her country in the last decade.[28]\n\nDeath[edit]\nMercedes Sosa lying in repose, with her family and President Cristina Fern√°ndez de Kirchner viewing\n\nSuffering from recurrent endocrine and respiratory problems in later years, the 74-year-old Sosa was hospitalized in Buenos Aires on 18 September 2009.[29] She died from multiple organ failure on 4 October 2009, at 5:15 am.[11] She is survived by one son, Fabi√°n Matus, born of her first marriage.[7][30] He said: \"She lived her 74 years to the fullest. She had done practically everything she wanted, she didn't have any type of barrier or any type of fear that limited her\".[30] The hospital expressed its sympathies to her relatives.[31] Her website featured the following: \"Her undisputed talent, her honesty and her profound convictions leave a great legacy to future generations\".[32]\n\nHer body was placed on display at the National Congress building in Buenos Aires for the public to pay their respects, and President Fern√°ndez de Kirchner ordered three days of national mourning.[30][33] Thousands had queued by the end of the day.[32][34]\n\nSosa's obituary in The Daily Telegraph said she was \"an unrivalled interpreter of works by her compatriot, the Argentine Atahualpa Yupanqui, and Chile's Violeta Parra\".[7] Helen Popper of Reuters reported her death by saying she \"fought South America's dictators with her voice and became a giant of contemporary Latin American music\".[34] Sosa received three Latin Grammy nominations for her album, in 2009 . She went on to win Best Folk Album about a month after her death.[4][9]\n\nTributes[edit]\n\nIn 2019, Sosa was celebrated by a Google Doodle. The doodle was showcased in Argentina, Chile, Uruguay, Paraguay, Bolivia, Peru, Ecuador, Cuba, Iceland, Sweden, Serbia, Greece, Israel and Vietnam.[35]\n\nIn 2023, Rolling Stone ranked Sosa at number 160 on its list of the 200 Greatest Singers of All Time.[36]\n\nDiscography[edit]\nSosa in 2005, with Argentina's then‚ÄìFirst Lady (later president from 2007 to 2015), Cristina Fern√°ndez de Kirchner\n\nSosa recorded forty albums.[4][9]\n\nStudio albums[edit]\nYear\tAlbum details\n1962\tLa Voz de la Zafra\nLabel: RCA\n\n1965\tCanciones Con Fundamento\nLabel: El Grillo\n\n1966\tHermano\nLabel: Philips\n\n1966\tYo No Canto Por Cantar\nLabel: Philips\n\n1967\tPara Cantarle a Mi Gente\nLabel: Philips\n\n1968\tCon Sabor a Mercedes Sosa\nLabel: Philips\n\n1969\tMujeres Argentinas\nLabel: Philips\n\n1970\tEl Grito de la Tierra\nLabel: Philips\n\n1970\tNavidad con Mercedes Sosa\nLabel: Philips\n\n1971\tHomenaje a Violeta Parra\nLabel: Philips\n\n1972\tHasta la Victoria\nLabel: Philips\n\n1972\tCantata Sudamericana\nLabel: Philips\n\n1973\tTraigo un Pueblo en Mi Voz\nLabel: Philips\n\n1975\tA Que Florezca Mi Pueblo\nLabel: Philips\n\n1976\tEn Direcci√≥n Del Viento\nLabel: Philips\n\n1977\tMercedes Sosa Interpreta a Atahualpa Yupanqui\nLabel: Philips\n\n1979\tSerenata Para la Tierra de Uno\nLabel: Philips\n\n1981\tA Quien Doy / Cuando Me Acuerdo de Mi Pa√≠s\nLabel: Philips\n\n1982\tComo Un P√°jaro Libre\nLabel: Philips\n\n1983\tMercedes Sosa\nLabel: Philips\n\n1984\t¬øSer√° Posible el Sur?\nLabel: Philips\n\n1985\tVengo a Ofrecer Mi Coraz√≥n\nLabel: Philips\n\n1986\tMercedes Sosa '86\nLabel: Philips\n\n1987\tMercedes Sosa '87\nLabel: Philips\n\n1993\tSino\nLabel: Philips/Polygram\n\n1994\tGestos de Amor\nLabel: Polydor\n\n1996\tEscondido en Mi Pa√≠s\nLabel: Polydor\n\n1997\tAlta Fidelidad (w/Charly Garc√≠a)\nLabel: Mercury\n\n1998\tAl Despertar\nLabel: Mercury\n\n1999\tMisa Criolla\nLabel: Mercury\n\n2005\tCoraz√≥n Libre\nLabel: Edge\n\n2009\tCantora 1 (w/various artists)\nLabel: RCA\n\n2009\tCantora 2 (w/various artists)\nLabel: RCA\n\n2011\tCensurada\nLabel: Philips\n\n2015\tLucerito\nLabel: RCA\nEPs[edit]\nYear\tEP details\n1975\tNi√±o de Ma√±ana\nLabel: Philips\nLive albums[edit]\nYear\tAlbum details\n1973\tSi Se Calla El Cantor (with Gloria Martin)\nLabel: Philips\n\n1980\tGravado Ao Vivo No Brasil\nLabel: Philips\n\n1982\tMercedes Sosa en Argentina\nLabel: Phonogram/Philips\n\n1985\tCoraz√≥n Americano (with Milton Nascimento & Le√≥n Gieco)\nLabel: Philips\n\n1989\tLive in Europe\nLabel: Tropical Music/Polygram Argentina\n\n1991\tDe M√≠\nLabel: Philips\n\n2002\tAc√∫stico en Vivo\nLabel: Sony Music Argentina\n\n2003\tArgentina Quiere Cantar (with V√≠ctor Heredia & Le√≥n Gieco)\nLabel: Odeon/EMI\n\n2010\tDeja la Vida Volar (En Gira)\nLabel: RCA\n\n2014\tAngel\nLabel: Universal Music\n\n2024\tEn vivo en el Gran Rex 2006\nLabel: INAMU Discos\n\nMercedes Sosa en Nueva York, 1974\nLabel: Sony Music Argentina\nCompilation albums[edit]\nYear\tAlbum details\n1975\tDisco de Oro\nLabel: Philips\n\n1983\tRecital\nLabel: Philips\n\n1988\tAmigos M√≠os\nLabel: Philips\n\n1993\t30 A√±os\nLabel: Polygram Argentina\n\n1995\tOro\nLabel: Polygram\n\n1997\tThe Best of Mercedes Sosa\nLabel: Mercury\n\n2013\tSiempre en Ti\nLabel: Universal Music\nFilmography[edit]\nG√ºemes, la tierra en armas (1971)\nArgentin√≠sima (1972)\nEsta es mi Argentina (1974)\nMercedes Sosa, como un p√°jaro libre (1983)\nSer√° possible el sur: Mercedes Sosa (1985)\nHistorias de Argentina en vivo (2001)\nReferences[edit]\n^ Mercedes Sosa at BrainyHistory.com\n^ \"Singer Mercedes Sosa: The voice of the 'voiceless ones' outlasts South American dictatorships\".\n^ \nJump up to:\na b c Heckman, Don (29 October 1995). \"POP MUSIC¬†: The Voice Heard Round the World¬†: Mercedes Sosa, a compelling figure in world music and a social activist, will make a rare L.A. appearance\".

In 1928, Sir Alexander Fleming was studying Staphylococcus bacteria growing in culture dishes. He noticed that a mold called Penicillium was also growing in some of the dishes. In Figure 1.13, Petri dish A represents a dish containing only Staphylococcus bacteria. The red dots in dish B represent Penicillium colonies. Fleming noticed that a clear area existed around the mold because all the bacteria grown in this area had died. In the culture dishes without the mold, no clear areas were present. Fleming suggested that the mold was producing a chemical that killed the bacteria. He decided to isolate this substance and test it to see if it would kill bacteria. Fleming grew some Penicillium mold in a nutrient broth. After the mold grew in the broth, he removed all the mold from the broth and added the broth to a culture of bacteria. All the bacteria died.\n\nWhich of the following statements is a reasonable expression of Fleming‚Äôs hypothesis?\nNutrient broth kills bacteria.\nThere are clear areas around the Penicillium mold where Staphylococcus doesn't grow.\nMold kills bacteria.\nPenicillium mold produces a substance that kills Staphylococcus.\nWithout mold in the culture dish, there were no clear areas in the bacteria.\nFleming grew Penicillium in broth, then removed the Penicillium and poured the broth into culture dishes containing bacteria to see if the broth would kill the bacteria. What step in the scientific method does this represent?\nCollecting and organizing data\nMaking a hypothesis\nTesting a hypothesis by experiment\nRejecting the old hypothesis and making a new one\nNone of these\n\nA scientific investigation is NOT valid unless every step in the scientific method is present and carried out in the exact order listed in this chapter.\n\nTrue\nFalse\n\nWhich of the following words is closest to the same meaning as hypothesis?\n\nfact\nlaw\nformula\nsuggestion\nconclusion\n\nWhy do scientists sometimes discard theories?\n\nthe steps in the scientific method were not followed in order\npublic opinion disagrees with the theory\nthe theory is opposed by the church\ncontradictory observations are found\ncongress voted against it\n\nGary noticed that two plants which his mother planted on the same day, that were the same size when planted, were different in size after three weeks. Since the larger plant was in the full sun all day and the smaller plant was in the shade of a tree most of the day, Gary believed the sunshine was responsible for the difference in the plant sizes. In order to test this, Gary bought ten small plants of the same size and type. He made sure they had the same size and type of pot. He also made sure they had the same amount and type of soil. Then Gary built a frame to hold a canvas roof over five of the plants while the other five were nearby but out in the sun. Gary was careful to make sure that each plant received exactly the same amount of water and plant food every day.\n\nWhich of the following is a reasonable statement of Gary‚Äôs hypothesis?\nDifferent plants have different characteristics.\nPlants that get more sunshine grow larger than plants that get less sunshine.\nPlants that grow in the shade grow larger.\nPlants that don‚Äôt receive water will die.\nPlants that receive the same amount of water and plant food will grow the same amount.\nWhat scientific reason might Gary have for insisting that the container size for the all plants be the same?\nGary wanted to determine if the size of the container would affect the plant growth.\nGary wanted to make sure the size of the container did not affect differential plant growth in his experiment.\nGary want to control how much plant food his plants received.\nGary wanted his garden to look organized.\nThere is no possible scientific reason for having the same size containers.\nWhat scientific reason might Gary have for insisting that all plants receive the same amount of water everyday?\nGary wanted to test the effect of shade on plant growth and therefore, he wanted to have no variables other than the amount of sunshine on the plants.\nGary wanted to test the effect of the amount of water on plant growth.\nGary's hypothesis was that water quality was affecting plant growth.\nGary was conserving water.\nThere is no possible scientific reason for having the same amount of water for each plant every day.\nWhat was the variable being tested in Gary's experiment?\nthe amount of water\nthe amount of plant food\nthe amount of soil\nthe amount of sunshine\nthe type of soil\nWhich of the following factors may be varying in Gary‚Äôs experimental setup that he did not control?\nindividual plant variation\nsoil temperature due to different colors of containers\nwater loss due to evaporation from the soil\nthe effect of insects which may attack one set of plants but not the other\nAll of the above are possible factors that Gary did not control.\n\nWhen a mosquito sucks blood from its host, it penetrates the skin with its sharp beak and injects an anti-coagulant so the blood will not clot. It then sucks some blood and removes its beak. If the mosquito carries disease-causing microorganisms, it injects these into its host along with the anti-coagulant. It was assumed for a long time that the virus typhus was injected by the louse when sucking blood in a manner similar to the mosquito. But apparently this is not so. The infection is not in the saliva of the louse, but in the feces. The disease is thought to be spread when the louse feces come in contact with scratches or bite wounds in the host's skin. A test of this was carried out in 1922 when two workers fed infected lice on a monkey, taking great care that no louse feces came into contact with the monkey. After two weeks, the monkey had NOT become ill with typhus. The workers then injected the monkey with typhus and it became ill within a few days. Why did the workers inject the monkey with typhus near the end of the experiment?\n\nto prove that the lice carried the typhus virus\nto prove the monkey was similar to man\nto prove that the monkey was not immune to typhus\nto prove that mosquitoes were not carriers of typhus\nthe workers were mean\n\nEijkman fed a group of chickens exclusively on rice whose seed coat had been removed (polished rice or white rice). The chickens all developed polyneuritis (a disease of chickens) and died. He fed another group of chickens unpolished rice (rice that still had its seed coat). Not a single one of them contracted polyneuritis. He then gathered the polishings from rice (the seed coats that had been removed) and fed the polishings to other chickens that were sick with polyneuritis. In a short time, the birds all recovered. Eijkman had accurately traced the cause of polyneuritis to a faulty diet. For the first time in history, a food deficiency disease had been produced and cured experimentally. Which of the following is a reasonable statement of Eijkman‚Äôs hypothesis?\n\nPolyneuritis is a fatal disease for chickens.\nWhite rice carries a virus for the disease polyneuritis.\nUnpolished rice does not carry the polyneuritis virus.\nThe rice seed coat contains a nutrient that provides protection for chickens against polyneuritis.\nNone of these is a reasonable statement of Eijkman's hypothesis.\n\nThe three questions below relate to the following paragraphs.\n\nScientist A noticed that in a certain forest area, the only animals inhabiting the region were giraffes. He also noticed that the only food available for the animals was on fairly tall trees and as the summer progressed, the animals ate the leaves high and higher on the trees. The scientist suggested that these animals were originally like all other animals but generations of animals stretching their necks to reach higher up the trees for food, caused the species to grow very long necks.\n\nScientist B conducted experiments and observed that stretching muscles does NOT cause bones to grow longer nor change the DNA of animals so that longer muscles would be passed on to the next generation. Scientist B, therefore, discarded Scientist A's suggested answer as to why all the animals living in the area had long necks. Scientist B suggested instead that originally many different types of animals including giraffes had lived in the region but only the giraffes could survive when the only food was high in the trees, and so all the other species had left the area.\n\nWhich of the following statements is an interpretation, rather than an observation?\nThe only animals living in the area were giraffes.\nThe only available food was on tall trees.\nAnimals which constantly stretch their necks will grow longer necks.\nA, B, and C are all interpretations.\nA, B, and C are all observations.\nScientist A's hypothesis was that\nthe only animals living in the area were giraffes.\nthe only available food was on tall trees.\nanimals which constantly stretch their necks will grow longer necks.\nthe animals which possess the best characteristics for living in an area, will be the predominant species.\nNone of the above are reasonable statements of Scientist A's hypothesis.\nScientist A's hypothesis being discarded is\nevidence that the scientific method doesn‚Äôt always work.\na result achieved without use of the scientific method.\nan example of what happened before the scientific method was invented.\nan example of the normal functioning of the scientific method.\nan unusual case.\n\nWhen a theory has been known for a long time, it becomes a law.\n\nTrue\nFalse\n\nDuring Pasteur's time, anthrax was a widespread and disastrous disease for livestock. Many people whose livelihood was raising livestock lost large portions of their herds to this disease. Around 1876, a horse doctor in eastern France named Louvrier, claimed to have invented a cure for anthrax. The influential men of the community supported Louvrier's claim to have cured hundreds of cows of anthrax. Pasteur went to Louvrier's hometown to evaluate the cure. The cure was explained to Pasteur as a multi-step process during which: 1) the cow was rubbed vigorously to make her as hot as possible; 2) long gashes were cut into the cows skin and turpentine was poured into the cuts; 3) an inch-thick coating of cow manure mixed with hot vinegar was plastered onto the cow and the cow was completely wrapped in a cloth. Since some cows recover from anthrax with no treatment, performing the cure on a single cow would not be conclusive, so Pasteur proposed an experiment to test Louvrier's cure. Four healthy cows were to be injected with anthrax microbes, and after the cows became ill, Louvrier would pick two of the cows (A and B) and perform his cure on them while the other two cows (C and D) would be left untreated. The experiment was performed and after a few days, one of the untreated cows died and one of them got better. Of the cows treated by Louvrier's cure, one cow died and one got better. In this experiment, what was the purpose of infecting cows C and D?\n\nSo that Louvrier would have more than two cows to choose from.\nTo make sure the injection actually contained anthrax.\nTo serve as experimental controls (a comparison of treated to untreated cows).\nTo kill as many cows as possible.\n\nA hypothesis is\n\na description of a consistent pattern in observations.\nan observation that remains constant.\na theory that has been proven.\na tentative explanation for a phenomenon.\n\nA number of people became ill after eating oysters in a restaurant. Which of the following statements is a hypothesis about this occurrence?\n\nEveryone who ate oysters got sick.\nPeople got sick whether the oysters they ate were raw or cooked.\nSymptoms included nausea and dizziness.\nThe cook felt really bad about it.\nBacteria in the oysters may have caused the illness.\n\nWhich statement best describes the reason for using experimental controls?\n\nExperimental controls eliminate the need for large sample sizes.\nExperimental controls eliminate the need for statistical tests.\nExperimental controls reduce the number of measurements needed.\nExperimental controls allow comparison between groups that are different in only one independent variable.\n\nA student decides to set up an experiment to determine the relationship between the growth rate of plants and the presence of detergent in the soil. He sets up 10 seed pots. In five of the seed pots, he mixes a precise amount of detergent with the soil and the other five seed pots have no detergent in the soil. The five seed pots with detergent are placed in the sun and the five seed pots with no detergent are placed in the shade. All 10 seed pots receive the same amount of water and the same number and type of seeds. He grows the plants for two months and charts the growth every two days. What is wrong with his experiment?\n\nThe student has too few pots.\nThe student has two independent variables.\nThe student has two dependent variables.\nThe student has no experimental control on the soil.\n\nA scientist plants two rows of corn for experimentation. She puts fertilizer on row 1 but does not put fertilizer on row 2. Both rows receive the same amount of sun and water. She checks the growth of the corn over the course of five months. What is acting as the control in this experiment?\n\nCorn without fertilizer.\nCorn with fertilizer.\nAmount of water.\nHeight of corn plants.\n\nIf you have a control group for your experiment, which of the following is true?\n\nThere can be more than one difference between the control group and the test group, but not more three differences, or else the experiment is invalid.\nThe control group and the test group may have many differences between them.\nThe control group must be identical to the test group except for one variable.\nNone of these are true.\n\nIf the hypothesis is rejected by the experiment, then:\n\nthe experiment may have been a success.\nthe experiment was a failure.\nthe experiment was poorly designed.\nthe experiment didn't follow the scientific method.\n\nA well-substantiated explanation of an aspect of the natural world is a:\n\ntheory.\nlaw.\nhypothesis.\nNone of these.\n\n1.5: A Beginning Chemist: How to Succeed\n\n1.E: Exercises is shared under a CK-12 license and was authored, remixed, and/or curated by Marisa Alviar-Agnew & Henry Agnew.\n\nLICENSED UNDER\nBack to top\n1.5: Physical Quantities- Units and Scientific Notation 2: Chemistry and Measurement\nWas this article helpful?\nYes\nNo\n?\n\nThe LibreTexts libraries are¬†Powered by NICE CXone Expert¬†and are supported by the Department of Education Open Textbook Pilot Project, the UC Davis Office of the Provost, the UC Davis Library, the California State University Affordable Learning Solutions Program, and Merlot.

It blew out a huge bi-lobed bubble that blasted through the interstellar medium in two directions. Whatever it was, it released huge amounts of energy from the central supermassive black hole, Sagittarius A (Sgr A for short).\n\nThese bubbles contain weird, spindly one-dimensional vertical filaments that emit radio signals of their own. In 1984, astronomer Farhad Yusef-Zadeh at Northwestern University and his collaborators were the first to observe these wispy trails. Now, they know of more than a thousand of them. They give off radio waves in the microwave portion of the electromagnetic spectrum.\n\nWait, There's More!\n\nRecently, the team found a smaller population of filaments near Sgr A*. However, these aren't vertical. Instead, they lie along the galactic plane and radiate away like spokes on a wheel. \"It was a surprise to suddenly find a new population of structures that seem to be pointing in the direction of the black hole,\" Yusef-Zadeh said. \"We have always been thinking about vertical filaments and their origin. I'm used to them being vertical. I never considered there might be others along the plane.\"\n\nHe and the team were stunned when they saw these radially stretched structures. \"We had to do a lot of work to establish that we weren't fooling ourselves,\" he said. \"And we found that these filaments are not random but appear to be tied to the outflow of our black hole. By studying them, we could learn more about the black hole's spin and accretion disk orientation. It is satisfying when one finds order in a middle of a chaotic field of the nucleus of our galaxy.\"\n\nYusef-Zadeh pointed out that something clearly occurred in the core to create the short radial filaments. \"We think they must have originated with some kind of outflow from an activity that happened a few million years ago,\" he said. \"It seems to be the result of an interaction of that outflowing material with objects near it.\"\n\nPinning Down Filament Histories\n\nLike other supermassive black holes, Sgr A* has been known to swallow up material occasionally. Then, it \"burps out\" an energetic, highly magnetized blast of energy and plasma. That seems the most likely explanation for the appearance of the bubbles and filaments. It's possible that such a jet collided with clouds of gas and dust in the immediate neighborhood. It could have led to twisted magnetic structures that form the filaments.\n\nAnother idea is that molecular gas got stretched by the expansion of the material near the core. That somehow creates the radial filaments. Such action would also explain the lopsided appearance of the Sgr E complex. It lies to one side of the black hole at the intersection of the central molecular zone and a wide central dust lane. Finally, it's also possible that the gravitational potential of our galaxy's central bar is tugging the Sgr E cloud. That could play a role in forming those filaments.\n\nThe vertical ones pose a different challenge to understand. They tower up to 150 light-years above the plane of the galaxy. Yusef-Zadeh and his team suggest a couple of ideas for their existence. The first is cosmic-ray pressure forcing filaments into a vertical orientation. That pressure is the aftermath of the explosive event a few million years ago that created the bubbles.\n\nSome verticals could be the result of the interaction of a large-scale wind in the region and obstacles embedded within the flow. That combination creates filaments by wrapping the wind's magnetic field around the obstacles. Clearly, there's a lot of observation work and analysis to be done in order to really understand what's happening to create both sets of filaments.\n\nDifferent Types of Filaments, Milky-Way Style\n\nTheir origins likely explain the radically different orientations and characteristics of each filament population. The vertical filaments are perpendicular to the plane of the galaxy and stretch up to around 150 light-years in length, while the horizontal ones are parallel to the plane and are only about 5 to 10 light-years long. The horizontals point radially toward the center of the galaxy where Sgr A* lies. The vertical ones are magnetic and relativistic (meaning their particles are moving near the speed of light). The horizontal filaments appear to emit thermal (warm) radiation and seem to be accelerating warmed material in a molecular cloud. There are just a few hundred of these horizontal filaments seen so far.\n\nThe vertical filaments appear around the nucleus of the galaxy while the horizontal ones spread out to only one side. According to Yusef-Zadeh, the radial outflows are somewhat lopsided. That may give some clues about the black hole region itself. \"One of the most important implications of radial outflow that we have detected is the orientation of the accretion disk and the jet-driven outflow from Sagittarius A* along the galactic plane,\" he said.\n\nLooking at the Filaments through Time\n\nWhile the radial filaments Yusef-Zadeh and his team found are a more recent discovery, the vertical ones are old friends. There are nearly a thousand of them grouped in pairs and clusters. Yusef-Zadeh says they are about 6 million years old.\n\nHe's been studying odd structures in the galactic core for decades. In 1984, he worked with astronomers Mark Morris and Don Chance to make a Very Large Array radio map of the galactic center in the 20-cm wavelength band when they first found the vertical structures. The emissions they detected came from nonthermally emitting (i.e. cool) gas arranged along magnetic structures.\n\nA video about the discovery of the radio bubble emanating from the center of the Milky Way Galaxy. Courtesy: Northwestern University.\n\nLater on, in 2019, Yusef-Zadeh was part of a team led by astronomer Ian Haywood (University of Oxford) that used the MeerKAT radio observatory facility in South Africa to discover two gigantic radio-emitting bubbles near Sgr A*. That huge burst of energetic activity described earlier created those bubbles several million years ago.\n\nAt the time, the team immediately suspected Sgr A* as a source of the hourglass-shaped structure. \"The center of our galaxy is relatively calm when compared to other galaxies with very active central black holes,\" said Heywood. \"Even so, the Milky Way's central black hole can‚Äîfrom time to time‚Äîbecome uncharacteristically active, flaring up as it periodically devours massive clumps of dust and gas. It's possible that one such feeding frenzy triggered powerful outbursts that inflated this previously unseen feature.\"\n\nMeerKAT Scans the Bubbles\n\nThe discovery of radio bubbles in the galactic core a few years ago highlighted the great capabilities of the MeerKAT radio telescope. It's an array of 64 radio dishes sensitive to emissions in the microwave regime, ranging from wavelengths between 3 to 30 centimeters. Yusef-Zadeh credits the facility with helping his team to pinpoint the filaments against a busy background of other emitters. They used a technique to remove the background and smooth the noise from MeerKAT images in order to isolate the filaments from surrounding structures.\n\n\"The new MeerKAT observations have been a game changer,\" he said. \"The advancement of technology and dedicated observing time have given us new information. It's really a technical achievement from radio astronomers.\"\n\nFor More Information\n\nMysterious dashes revealed in Milky Way‚Äôs Center\nThe Population of the Galactic Center Filaments: Position Angle Distribution Reveals a Degree-scale Collimated Outflow from Sgr A* along the Galactic Plane\nGiant balloon-like structures discovered at Center of Milky Way\nMeerKAT Radio Telescope\n\nCarolyn Collins Petersen\n\nCarolyn Collins Petersen is a long-time science writer and former astronomy researcher.

Yusef-Zadeh, R. G. Arendt, M. Wardle, I. Heywood\nWe have examined the distribution of the position angle (PA) of the Galactic center filaments with lengths L > 66'' and < 66'' as well as their length distribution as a function of PA. We find bimodal PA distributions of the filaments, long and short populations of radio filaments. Our PA study shows the evidence for a distinct population of short filaments with PA close to the Galactic plane. Mainly thermal short radio filaments (<66'') have PAs concentrated close to the Galactic plane within 60^\\circ < \\rm PA <120^\\circ. Remarkably, the short filament PAs are radial with respect to the Galactic center at l <0^\\circ, and extend in the direction toward Sgr A*. On a smaller scale, the prominent Sgr E HII complex G358.7-0.0 provides a vivid example of the nearly radial distribution of short filaments. The bimodal PA distribution suggests different origin for two distinct filament populations. We argue that alignment of the short filament population results from the ram pressure of a degree-scale outflow from Sgr A* that exceeds the internal filament pressure, and aligns them along the Galactic plane. The ram pressure is estimated to be 2\\times10^6\\, cm^{-3}\\, K at a distance of 300pc, requiring biconical mass outflow rate 10^{-4} \\msol\\, yr^{-1} with an opening angle of \\sim40^\\circ. This outflow aligns not only the magnetized filaments along the Galactic plane but also accelerates thermal material associated with embedded or partially embedded clouds. This places an estimate of \\sim6 Myr as the age of the outflow.\nComments:\t19 pages, 8 figures, ApJL (June 2nd, 2023)\nSubjects:\tAstrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA)\nCite as:\tarXiv:2306.01071 [astro-ph.GA]\n¬†\t(or arXiv:2306.01071v1 [astro-ph.GA] for this version)\n¬†\t\nhttps://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2306.01071\nFocus to learn more\n\nRelated DOI:\t\nhttps://doi.org/10.3847/2041-8213/acd54b\nFocus to learn more\nSubmission history\nFrom: Farhad Yusef-Zadeh [view email]\n[v1] Thu, 1 Jun 2023 18:17:48 UTC (27,230 KB)\n\nAccess Paper:\nView PDF\nTeX Source\nOther Formats\nview license\nCurrent browse context:\nastro-ph.GA\n<¬†prev ¬† | ¬† next¬†>\n\nnew | recent | 2023-06\nChange to browse by:\nastro-ph\n\nReferences & Citations\nNASA ADS\nGoogle Scholar\nSemantic Scholar\nExport BibTeX Citation\nBookmark\n \nBibliographic Tools\nBibliographic and Citation Tools\nBibliographic Explorer Toggle\nBibliographic Explorer (What is the Explorer?)\nConnected Papers Toggle\nConnected Papers (What is Connected Papers?)\nLitmaps Toggle\nLitmaps (What is Litmaps?)\nscite.ai Toggle\nscite Smart Citations (What are Smart Citations?)\nCode, Data, Media\nDemos\nRelated Papers\nAbout arXivLabs\nWhich authors of this paper are endorsers? | Disable MathJax (What is MathJax?)\nAbout\nHelp\nContact\nSubscribe\nCopyright\nPrivacy Policy\nWeb Accessibility Assistance\n\narXiv Operational Status \nGet status notifications via email or slack\n\n\nThought: The extracted content does not provide the NASA award number.

The city of Amsterdam had previously bid for the 1920 and 1924 Olympic Games. Still, it was obliged to give way to war-torn Antwerp in Belgium for the 1920 Games and Pierre de Coubertin's Paris for the 1924 Games.\n\nThe only other candidate city for the 1928 Olympics was Los Angeles, which would eventually be selected to host the Olympics four years later. In preparation for the 1932 Summer Olympics, the United States Olympic Committee reviewed the costs and revenue of the 1928 Games. The committee reported a total cost of US$1.183 million with receipts of US$1.165 million, giving a negligible loss of US$18,000, which was a considerable improvement over the 1924 Games.[2]\n\nThe United States won the most gold and medals overall.\n\nBidding process[edit]\n\nDutch nobleman Frederik van Tuyll van Serooskerken first proposed Amsterdam as the host city for the Summer Olympic Games in 1912, even before the Netherlands Olympic Committee was established.\n\nThe Olympic Games were canceled in 1916 due to World War¬†I. In 1919, the Netherlands Olympic Committee abandoned the proposal of Amsterdam in favor of their support for the nomination of Antwerp as host city for the 1920 Summer Olympics. In 1921, Paris was selected for the 1924 Summer Olympics on the condition that the 1928 Summer Olympics would be organized in Amsterdam. This decision, supported by the Netherlands Olympic Committee, was announced by the International Olympic Committee (IOC) on 2¬†June 1921.\n\nLos Angeles' bid for the 1928 Summer Olympics was unsuccessful in 1922 and again in 1923.[3] The city was eventually selected as host city for the 1932 Summer Olympics, being the only bidder for that year.[4]:‚Ääp.915‚Ää\n\nOrganization and Innovations[edit]\nThese were the first Olympics to be organized under the IOC presidency of Henri de Baillet-Latour.\nThese Games were the first to bear the name \"Summer Olympic Games\", to distinguish them from the Winter Olympic Games (held since 1924).\nThese Games were the first to feature a fixed schedule of sixteen days, which is still followed since 1984. In previous Olympics, competition had been stretched out over several months.\nThe events were entirely funded through private donations with the government of the host nation providing no financial support for the first time.[5]\nThe American company Coca-Cola made its first appearance as an official sponsor of the Olympic Games, remaining the oldest Olympic sponsor to this day.[6]\nCeremonies and Traditions[edit]\nA symbolic fire was lit for the first time during the Olympics, a tradition that continues today.[7] The first Olympic flame and torch relay, however, would not take place until the 1936 Summer Olympics.\nFor the first time, the parade of nations started with Greece, which holds the origins of the Olympics, and ended with the host country, a tradition that has continued ever since.\nThe Games were officially opened by Prince Hendrik, consort of Queen Wilhelmina, who had authorized her husband to deputize for her.[4]:‚Ääp.294‚Ää The Queen was unable to attend the opening ceremony as she was on holiday in Norway and did not want to disrupt her trip.[8] This was the second time a head of state had not personally officiated at an Olympic opening ceremony (the first occasion being the 1904 Games in St.¬†Louis, Missouri, which were officially opened by David R. Francis, the Mayor of St.¬†Louis). The Queen had initially refused to appear at either the opening or closing ceremony; it is thought that she objected to the Netherlands hosting the 1928 Games as she considered the Olympics a demonstration of paganism.[9] However, she returned from Norway before the conclusion of the Games, to be present at the closing ceremony,[10] and she presented the first prizes at the prize distribution which was held immediately beforehand.[4]:‚Ääp.913‚Ää\nAthlete highlights[edit]\nPaavo Nurmi of Finland won his ninth, and final, gold medal in the 10,000¬†m race.\nCanadian athlete Percy Williams exceeded expectations by winning both the 100¬†m and 200¬†m sprint events.\nCrown Prince Olav, who would later become King of Norway, won a gold medal in the 6¬†meter sailing event.\nPat O'Callaghan won the first ever medal for a newly independent Ireland, taking gold in the hammer throw.\nMikio Oda of Japan won the triple jump event with a result of 15.21¬†m (49¬†ft 10.82¬†in), becoming the first gold medalist from an Asian country.\nBetty Robinson of the USA won the women's 100 metres in a world record time of 12.2 seconds. She was still just 16 years of age at the time.\nAlgerian-born marathon runner Boughera El Ouafi won a gold medal for France in the men's marathon.\nJohnny Weissmuller, who later appeared in several Tarzan movies, won two gold medals in swimming: an individual gold in the men's 100¬†m freestyle, and a team gold in the men's 4¬†√ó¬†200¬†m freestyle relay.[11][12]\nGermany returned to the Olympic Games for the first time since 1912, after being banned from the 1920 and 1924 Games due to its role in World War I. The German team immediately finished second in the 1928 medal count.\nSouth American football made a definite breakthrough, as Uruguay retained its title by defeating Argentina.\nIndia took its first ever gold medal in field hockey, beginning a streak of six consecutive gold medals in the sport.\nSports[edit]\n\nDuring the 1928 Summer Olympics, there were 14 sports, 20 disciplines and 109 events in the tournament. In parentheses is the number of events per discipline.[4]:‚Ääpp.973‚Äì985‚Ää\n\nAquatics\n¬†Diving (4)\n¬†Swimming (11)\n¬†Water polo (1)\n¬†Athletics (27)\n¬†Boxing (8)\n¬†Cycling\nRoad (2)\nTrack (4)\n¬†Equestrian\nDressage (2)\nEventing (2)\nShow jumping (2)\n¬†Fencing (7)\n¬†Field hockey (1)\n¬†Football (1)\n¬†Gymnastics (8)\n¬†Modern pentathlon (1)\n¬†Rowing (7)\n¬†Sailing (3)\n¬†Weightlifting (5)\n¬†Wrestling\nFreestyle (7)\nGreco-Roman (6)\n\nWomen's athletics and team gymnastics debuted at these Olympics,[13] in spite of criticism. Five women's athletics events were added: 100 meters, 800 meters, high jump, discus, and 400 meter hurdles. In protest of the limited number of events, British women athletes, boycotted the Games.[14] Halina Konopacka of Poland became the first female Olympic track and field champion. Reports that the 800 meter run ended with several of the competitors being completely exhausted were widely (and erroneously) circulated. As a result, the IOC decided that women were too frail for long-distance running, and women's Olympic running events were limited to 200 meters until the 1960s.[15]\n\nTennis disappeared from the program until it reappeared in 1968 as a demonstration sport.\n\nDemonstration sports[edit]\nKaatsen (not considered official by the IOC)[16]\nKorfball\nLacrosse\n\nThese Games also included art competitions in five categories: architecture, painting, sculpture, literature, and music.[5] However, the IOC no longer considers these to be official medal events, so the medals awarded are not included in today's Olympic medal counts.[17]\n\nVenues[edit]\nThe Olympisch Stadion in 1928\n\nFourteen sports venues were used for the 1928 Summer Olympics. The Swim Stadium was demolished in 1929.[4]:‚Ääp.193‚Ää The Het Kasteel football stadium was renovated in 1998‚Äì99. The Monnikenhuize stadium was demolished in 1950. The Schermzaal sports hall has also been demolished. The Olympic Stadium was renovated between 1996 and 2000, and is still in use. The Old Stadion was demolished in 1929 and replaced with housing in the Amsterdam area.\n\nMany cars were expected for the Games, but Amsterdam had at most 2,000 single-car parking spaces. Consequently, several new parking sites were provided, and a special parking symbol was launched to show foreign visitors where they could park. The white P on a blue background was to become the international traffic sign for parking, which is still used today.[18][19] Athletics events were held on a 400-meter track, later becoming the standard for athletics tracks.\n\nVenue\tSports\tCapacity\tRef.\nAmersfoort\tModern pentathlon (riding)\tNot listed\t[4]:‚Ääp.277‚Ää\nAmsterdam\tCycling (road)\tNot listed\t[4]:‚Ääp.264‚Ää\nBuiten-IJ\tSailing\t2,263\t[4]:‚Ääpp.271‚Äì4‚Ää\nHilversum\tEquestrian (dressage and cross-country), Modern pentathlon (running)\t4,763\t[4]:‚Ääpp.167,‚Ää236,‚Ää694‚Ää\nKrachtsportgebouw\tBoxing, Weightlifting, Wrestling\t4,634\t[4]:‚Ääpp.200‚Äì1,‚Ää205‚Ää\nMonnikenhuize (Arnhem)\tFootball\t7,500\t[20]\nOld Stadion\tField hockey, Football\t29,787\t[4]:‚Ääpp.173‚Äì80‚Ää\nOlympic Sports Park Swim Stadium\tDiving, Modern pentathlon (swimming), Swimming, Water polo\t6,000\t[4]:‚Ääpp.205‚Äì9‚Ää\nOlympic Stadium\tAthletics, Cycling (track), Equestrian (jumping), Football, Gymnastics, Korfball\t33,025\t[4]:‚Ääpp.173‚Äì205‚Ää\nSchermzaal\tFencing, Modern pentathlon (fencing)\t559\t[4]:‚Ääpp.170,‚Ää202,‚Ää205‚Ää\nSloterringvaart, Sloten\tRowing\t2,230\t[4]:‚Ääpp.172,‚Ää267‚Äì72‚Ää\nSparta Stadion Het Kasteel (Rotterdam)\tFootball\t11,026\t[21][22]\nZeeburg Shooting Grounds\tModern pentathlon (shooting)\t10,455\t[4]:‚Ääp.277‚Ää\nZuiderzee\tSailing\t2,263\t[4]:‚Ääpp.271‚Äì4‚Ää\nBuiten-IJ\nOlympic Stadium\nOlympic Sports Park Swim Stadium\nSloten\nZeeburg\nZuiderzee\nclass=notpageimage|\nMap of the Amsterdam region with Olympic venues marked.

Malta, Panama, and Rhodesia (now Zimbabwe) competed at the Olympic Games for the first time. Germany returned after having been banned in 1920 and 1924.[23]\n\nThe nations that participated in the previous games in Paris 1924 but were absent in Amsterdam 1928 were Brazil and Ecuador.\n\nAt the time,¬†Australia, New Zealand,¬†Canada, South Africa and Ireland were all dominions of the¬†British Empire. India and Rhodesia were also a part of the British Empire, but were not dominions. For other sovereign states (i.e.¬†United States,¬†France,¬†Argentina,¬†Japan, etc) and the international community as a whole (i.e¬†League of Nations) the term dominion, used internally in the British Empire, was very ambiguous, meaning \"something between a colony and state\". It was only years later with the Statute of Westminster 1931 that this ambiguity would be dispelled. Philippines was an unincorporated territory and commonwealth of the United States.\n\nhide\nParticipating National Olympic Committees\n\n¬†Argentina¬†(81 athletes)\n¬†Australia¬†(18)\n¬†Austria¬†(73)\n¬†Belgium¬†(186)\n¬†Bulgaria¬†(5)\n¬†Canada¬†(69)\n¬†Chile¬†(38)\n¬†Cuba¬†(1)\n¬†Czechoslovakia¬†(70)\n¬†Denmark¬†(91)\n¬†Estonia¬†(20)\n¬†Egypt¬†(32)\n¬†Finland¬†(69)\n¬†France¬†(255)\n¬†Germany¬†(296)\n¬†Great Britain¬†(232)\n¬†Greece¬†(23)\n¬†Haiti¬†(2)\n¬†Hungary¬†(109)\n¬†India¬†(21)\n¬†Ireland¬†(27)\n¬†Italy¬†(174)\n¬†Japan¬†(43)\n¬†Latvia¬†(14)\n¬†Lithuania¬†(12)\n¬†Luxembourg¬†(46)\n¬†Malta¬†(9)\n¬†Mexico¬†(30)\n¬†Monaco¬†(7)\n¬†Netherlands¬†(264) (host)\n¬†New Zealand¬†(10)\n¬†Norway¬†(52)\n¬†Panama¬†(1)\n¬†Philippines¬†(4)\n¬†Poland¬†(93)\n¬†Portugal¬†(31)\n¬†Rhodesia¬†(2)\n¬†Romania¬†(29)\n¬†South Africa¬†(24)\n¬†Spain¬†(80)\n¬†Switzerland¬†(133)\n¬†Sweden¬†(100)\n¬†Turkey¬†(31)\n¬†United States¬†(280)\n¬†Uruguay¬†(22)\n¬†Yugoslavia¬†(34)\nNumber of athletes by National Olympic Committees[edit]\nshow\nCountry\tAthletes\n\nMedal count[edit]\nMain articles: 1928 Summer Olympics medal table and List of 1928 Summer Olympics medal winners\n\nThese are the top ten nations that won medals at the 1928 Games.\n\nRank\tNation\tGold\tSilver\tBronze\tTotal\n1\t¬†United States\t22\t18\t16\t56\n2\t¬†Germany\t10\t7\t14\t31\n3\t¬†Finland\t8\t8\t9\t25\n4\t¬†Sweden\t7\t6\t12\t25\n5\t¬†Italy\t7\t5\t7\t19\n6\t¬†Switzerland\t7\t4\t4\t15\n7\t¬†France\t6\t10\t5\t21\n8\t¬†Netherlands*\t6\t9\t4\t19\n9\t¬†Hungary\t4\t5\t0\t9\n10\t¬†Canada\t4\t4\t7\t15\nTotals (10 entries)\t81\t76\t78\t235\nPoster[edit]\nOfficial poster\n\nThe official poster for the Games displaying a running man in a white shirt was designed by Jos Rovers however the IOC never succeeded in obtaining the copyright of the image. The IOC used a different poster, with the German text Olympische Spiele, and an athlete partly covered in the Dutch national flag, holding a peace leaf in his hand. The poster was made for a German book about the Amsterdam Olympics.[24]\n\nLast surviving competitor[edit]\n\nThe last living competitor of the 1928 Summer Olympics was Carla Marangoni, a member of the silver medal-winning Italian gymnastic team who had been twelve years old during the Olympics. Marangoni died 18 January 2018, at the age of 102 as the oldest living Olympic medalist at the time of her death.[25]\n\nSee also[edit]\n\tOlympic Games portal\n1928 Winter Olympics\nList of IOC country codes\nNotes[edit]\n^ Although Flevoland is depicted in this map, it did not exist at this time.\nReferences[edit]\n^ \"Factsheet ‚Äì Opening Ceremony of the Games f the Olympiad\" (PDF) (Press release).
